INTRODUCTION                                               *fantableous-intro*

fantableous is a markdown style table editor, generator, and spreadsheet
engine written in lua and using treesitter. It is designed to be used
alongside the neovim plugin 'nvim-orgmode/orgmode', or as a standalone tool.

Until this plugin reaches feature parity with 'dhruvasagar/vim-table-mode'
it is recommended to have that plugin installed as well.
Conflicting keybinds should not matter since each feature provided is an
atomic operation for each plugin. Otherwise you may want to ensure that this
plugin is loaded second of the two, so that its keybinds take precedence.
